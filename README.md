# Project 0


Hello!

Here is my website about my interests! I made this website for CS50's Project 0.
In index.html file, you can find the home page of my website. In interest1.html file, you can find the interest 1 of my webpage. As same as interest2.html and interest3.html. My css file is project1.css. I made that file with project0.scss. I named it like project1.css because I accidentaly opened a project0.css file before and I didn't want to change it. So, the css file is project1.css. Hope you like it!. I used BOOTSTRAP 4 and Sass for this project! 
Have a nice day,
Emir Hurturk
